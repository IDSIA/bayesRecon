To Do file for package
================
2023-03-29

## Short term to do

- Decide Gitlab vs Github (it is possible to make a Gitlab repo public,
  just not by us)
- Push to repo
- Decide which emaile we prefer to use (Dario prefers gmail for R
  pacakges)

## Long term to do

- Decide who is maintainer
- Decide licence (LGPL3 is reasonable for use also in Innosuisse
  projects)
- In case it is needed expand package to use Rcpp
  (`usethis::use_rcpp_armadillo()`)
