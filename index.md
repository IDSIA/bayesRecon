The package `bayesRecon` implements several methods for probabilistic
reconciliation of hierarchical time series forecasts.

The main functions are:

- `reconc_gaussian`: reconciliation via conditioning of multivariate
  Gaussian base forecasts; this is done analytically;
- `reconc_BUIS`: reconciliation via conditioning of any probabilistic
  forecast via importance sampling; this is the recommended option for
  non-Gaussian base forecasts;
- `reconc_MCMC`: reconciliation via conditioning of discrete
  probabilistic forecasts via Markov Chain Monte Carlo;
- `reconc_MixCond`: reconciliation via conditioning of mixed
  hierarchies, where the upper forecasts are multivariate Gaussian and
  the bottom forecasts are discrete distributions;
- `reconc_TDcond`: reconciliation via top-down conditioning of mixed
  hierarchies, where the upper forecasts are multivariate Gaussian and
  the bottom forecasts are discrete distributions.

## Getting started 

The starting point for `bayesRecon` functions is the vignette ["Get Started"](https://idsia.github.io/bayesRecon/articles/bayesRecon.html). 
You can all find documentation in [Reference section](https://idsia.github.io/bayesRecon/reference/index.html) and additional vignettes in the Articles section. 
Finally a short example with code is provided below. 
  
  
## Installation

You can install the **stable** version on [R
CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bayesRecon)

## Examples

Let us consider the minimal temporal hierarchy in the figure, where the
bottom variables are the two 6-monthly forecasts and the upper variable
is the yearly forecast. We denote the variables for the two semesters
and the year by $S_1, S_2, Y$ respectively.

<img src="./man/figures/minimal_hierarchy.png" alt="Graph of a minimal hierarchy with two bottom and one upper variable." width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The hierarchy is described by the *aggregation matrix* A, which can be
obtained using the function `get_reconc_matrices`.

``` r
library(bayesRecon)

rec_mat <- get_reconc_matrices(agg_levels = c(1, 2), h = 2)
A <- rec_mat$A
print(A)
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    1
```

### Example 1: Poisson base forecasts

We assume that the base forecasts are Poisson distributed, with
parameters given by $\lambda_{Y} = 9$, $\lambda_{S_1} = 2$, and
$\lambda_{S_2} = 4$.

``` r
lambdaS1 <- 2
lambdaS2 <- 4
lambdaY <- 9
lambdas <- c(lambdaY, lambdaS1, lambdaS2)
n_tot = length(lambdas)

base_forecasts = list()
for (i in 1:n_tot) {
  base_forecasts[[i]] = list(lambda = lambdas[i])
}
```

We recommend using the BUIS algorithm (Zambon et al., 2024) to sample
from the reconciled distribution.

``` r
buis <- reconc_BUIS(
  A,
  base_forecasts,
  in_type = "params",
  distr = "poisson",
  num_samples = 100000,
  seed = 42
)

samples_buis <- buis$reconciled_samples
```

Since there is a positive incoherence in the forecasts
($\lambda_Y > \lambda_{S_1}+\lambda_{S_2}$), the mean of the bottom
reconciled forecast increases. We show below this behavior for $S_1$.

``` r
reconciled_forecast_S1 <- buis$bottom_reconciled_samples[1,]
range_forecats <- range(reconciled_forecast_S1)
hist(
  reconciled_forecast_S1,
  breaks = seq(range_forecats[1] - 0.5, range_forecats[2] + 0.5),
  freq = F,
  xlab = "S_1",
  ylab = NULL,
  main = "base vs reconciled"
)
points(
  seq(range_forecats[1], range_forecats[2]),
  stats::dpois(seq(range_forecats[1], range_forecats[2]), lambda =
                 lambdaS1),
  pch = 16,
  col = 4,
  cex = 2
)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" alt="PMF of base versus reconciled forecasts." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The blue circles represent the probability mass function of a Poisson
with parameter $\lambda_{S_1}$ plotted on top of the histogram of the
reconciled bottom forecasts for $S_1$. Note how the histogram is shifted
to the right.

Moreover, while the base bottom forecast were assumed independent, the
operation of reconciliation introduced a negative correlation between
$S_1$ and $S_2$. We can visualize it with the plot below which shows the
empirical correlations between the reconciled samples of $S_1$ and the
reconciled samples of $S_2$.

``` r
AA <-
  xyTable(buis$bottom_reconciled_samples[1, ],
          buis$bottom_reconciled_samples[2, ])
plot(
  AA$x ,
  AA$y ,
  cex = AA$number * 0.001  ,
  pch = 16 ,
  col = rgb(0, 0, 1, 0.4) ,
  xlab = "S_1" ,
  ylab = "S_2" ,
  xlim = range(buis$bottom_reconciled_samples[1, ]) ,
  ylim = range(buis$bottom_reconciled_samples[2, ])
)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" alt="Bubble plot of correlations between S1 and S2." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We also provide a function for sampling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(Corani et al., 2023).

``` r
mcmc = reconc_MCMC(
  A,
  base_forecasts,
  distr = "poisson",
  num_samples = 30000,
  seed = 42
)

samples_mcmc <- mcmc$reconciled_samples
```

### Example 2: Gaussian base forecasts

We now assume that the base forecasts are Gaussian distributed, with
parameters given by

- $\mu_{Y} = 9$, $\mu_{S_1} = 2$, and $\mu_{S_2} = 4$;
- $\sigma_{Y} = 2$, $\sigma_{S_1} = 2$, and $\sigma_{S_2} = 3$.

``` r
muS1 <- 2
muS2 <- 4
muY <- 9
mus <- c(muY, muS1, muS2)

sigmaS1 <- 2
sigmaS2 <- 2
sigmaY <- 3
sigmas <- c(sigmaY, sigmaS1, sigmaS2)

base_forecasts = list()
for (i in 1:n_tot) {
  base_forecasts[[i]] = list(mean = mus[[i]], sd = sigmas[[i]])
}
```

We use the BUIS algorithm to sample from the reconciled distribution:

``` r
buis <- reconc_BUIS(
  A,
  base_forecasts,
  in_type = "params",
  distr = "gaussian",
  num_samples = 100000,
  seed = 42
)
samples_buis <- buis$reconciled_samples
buis_means <- rowMeans(samples_buis)
```

If the base forecasts are Gaussian, the reconciled distribution is still
Gaussian and can be computed in closed form:

``` r
Sigma <- diag(sigmas ^ 2)  #transform into covariance matrix
analytic_rec <- reconc_gaussian(A,
                                base_forecasts.mu = mus,
                                base_forecasts.Sigma = Sigma)
analytic_means_bottom <- analytic_rec$bottom_reconciled_mean
analytic_means_upper <- A %*% analytic_means_bottom
analytic_means <- rbind(analytic_means_upper,analytic_means_bottom)
```

The base means of $Y$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ are 9, 2, 4.

The reconciled means obtained analytically are 7.41, 2.71, 4.71, while
the reconciled means obtained via BUIS are 7.41, 2.71, 4.71.
