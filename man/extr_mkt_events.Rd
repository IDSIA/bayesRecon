\description{
Count time series of extreme market events in five economic sectors.
The data refer to the trading days between 2004/12/31 and 2018/12/19 (3508 trading days in total).
}
\details{
The counts are computed by considering 29 companies included in the Euro Stoxx
50 index and observing if the value of the CDS spread on a given day exceeds
the 90-th percentile of its distribution in the last trading year.
The companies are divided in the following  sectors: Financial (FIN), Information
and Communication Technology (ICT), Manufacturing (MFG), Energy (ENG), and Trade (TRD).

There are 6 time series:
\itemize{
\item 5 bottom time series, corresponding to the daily counts for each sector
\item 1 upper time series, which is the sum of all the bottom (ALL)
}
