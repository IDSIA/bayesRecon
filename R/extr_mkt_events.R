#' Extreme market events dataset
#'
#' Count time series of extreme market events in five economic sectors.
#' The data refer to the trading days between 2004/12/31 and 2018/12/19 (3508 trading days in total).
#' 
#' The counts are computed by considering 29 companies included in the Euro Stoxx 
#' 50 index and observing if the value of the CDS spread on a given day exceeds 
#' the 90-th percentile of its distribution in the last trading year.
#' The companies are divided in the following  sectors: Financial (FIN), Information 
#' and Communication Technology (ICT), Manufacturing (MFG), Energy (ENG), and Trade (TRD). 
#' 
#' There are 6 time series: 
#' - 5 bottom time series, corresponding to the daily counts for each sector
