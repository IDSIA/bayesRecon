```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## General

* Create a test for the case where .fix_weights returns a warning.


## Docs

* Docs MCMC: add link/reference for MCMC convergence checks




## Long term to do

* Change documentation of reconc_buis and reconc_mcmc: distr can be a list of strings (also in_type?)

* Check on list of distributions (if a bottom is continuous, then all the upper must be continuous)

* Control on effective sample size to check for weights collapse

* Extension to batch-BUIS?

* check use of parallel computation on local cores for batch BUIS.

* Add zero-inflation

* Add "fixed forecast" (i.e. Dirac delta)
